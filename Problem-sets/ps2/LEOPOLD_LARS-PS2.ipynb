    "## Introduction to the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using data from the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper \"[School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387803001858)\", by Paul Shultz (available on bCourses). Please familiarize yourself with the PROGRESA program before beginning this problem set, so you have a rough sense of where the data come from and how they were generated. If you just proceed into the problem set without understanding Progresa or the data, it will be very difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem set is to implement some of the basic econometric techniques that you are learning in class to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates. The timeline of the program was:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Baseline survey conducted in 1997\n",
    " * Intervention begins in 1998, \"Wave 1\" of surveys conducted in 1998\n",
    " * \"Wave 2\" of surveys conducted in 1999\n",
    " * Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated. \n",
    " \n",
    "When you are ready, download the progresa_sample.csv data from bCourses. The data are actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program.  In this file, each row corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are surveyed in each year. For each child-year observation, the following variables are collected:\n",

    "\n",
    "Present summary statistics (mean, standard error, and the values at the 5th and 95th percentiles) for all of the demographic variables in the dataset (i.e., everything except year, folnum, village). Present these in a single table alphabetized by variable name. Do NOT simply expect the grader to scroll through your output!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* For this and subsequent problems, you will need to be careful in how you deal with missing (NULL) values. You should not blindly drop rows and columns where any data field is missing.  For instance, in calculating the average `hohwag`, you should average the `hohwag` values from all households that report a value (even if the household does not have a recorded `age` value, for example).
